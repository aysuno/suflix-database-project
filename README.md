# SUFLIX: Movie Rental Database Management System

In the SUFLIX project, we have designed a website where the user can rent movies. This is a
website with the functions of a classic e-commerce site. Our main objectives were to introduce a movie rental database, working at two main mechanisms: 
Admins adding movies to the database and customers selecting desired movies, adding them to cart and paying. In addition to these, customers will be able to give 
feedback too. 

This project was carried out within the scope of SabancÄ± University CS306 Database Systems Course. This project is written in PHP, its interface is created with HTML and CSS.
